An armed conflict between Israel and Hamas-led Palestinian militant groups[r] has been taking place chiefly in and around the Gaza Strip since 7 October 2023. On that day, Palestinian militant groups launched a surprise attack on southern Israel from the Gaza Strip, initiating the most significant military escalation in the region since the Yom Kippur War 50 years earlier.[78] After clearing Hamas militants from its territory, the Israeli military embarked on an extensive aerial bombardment of the Gaza Strip followed by a large-scale ground invasion beginning on 27 October. Clashes have also occurred in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and with Hezbollah along the Israel–Lebanon border. The hostilities constitute the fifth war of the Gaza–Israel conflict since 2008, part of the broader Israeli–Palestinian conflict.[79]

The war began when Hamas-led Palestinian militant groups launched a surprise offensive against Israel named "Operation Al-Aqsa Flood." The attack began with a barrage of rockets targeting Israel, while around 3,000 militants breached the Gaza–Israel barrier and attacked neighboring Israeli communities and military bases. During this attack, 1,139 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed, including 766 civilians and 373 security forces,[s][80][81][82] while 253 Israelis and foreigners were taken captive to the Gaza Strip.[83][84] In response, Israel declared a state of war, tightened its blockade, ordered the evacuation of the northern Gaza Strip, and launched "Operation Swords of Iron" with the stated goals of destroying Hamas and freeing the hostages.[85][86][87] Analysts suggested that Palestinian frustration at Arab–Israeli normalization despite the ongoing blockade of Gaza and rising settler violence in the West Bank contributed to the attack by Hamas.[88][89][90] Hamas said its attack was in response to the continued Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories, the blockade of the Gaza Strip, the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements, as well as the alleged aim of "Judaization" of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the plight of Palestinian refugees and prisoners.[91][92][93][94][95]

Since the start of the Israeli operation,[96] more than 28,858 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza,[30] including over 12,300 children,[97] 152 UN staff members,[98] 70 journalists,[99] and 8,400 women[97] with another 7,000 people missing and presumed dead under the rubble of destroyed buildings.[100][101] According to Gaza's Health Ministry, children make up 43% of total deaths, and women and minors make up three-quarters.[97] By mid-December, Israel had dropped 29,000 munitions on Gaza, destroying or damaging 70 percent of homes in the Strip.[102] Experts say that the scale and pace of destruction in Gaza is among the most severe in modern history.[103][104][105] A humanitarian crisis has developed in the Gaza Strip, with healthcare in a state of collapse,[106] shortages of food, clean water, medicine and fuel due to the blockade,[107][108][109] electricity and communications blackouts,[110] and the UN warning of potential famine.[111] It was widely reported that there is "no safe place in Gaza" as Israel struck areas it had previously told Palestinians to evacuate to.[112][113][114] The widespread civilian deaths have led to accusations of war crimes against both Israel and Hamas.[115][116] Nearly all of Gaza's 2.3 million population have been internally displaced[117] and around 250,000–500,000 Israelis were internally displaced,[118][119][120] while thousands of Palestinians have been detained by Israel,[121][122][123] and Israel has lost 225 additional soldiers in its invasion as of 4 February 2024.[124]

Throughout the war, there have been widespread global protests that have primarily called for a ceasefire.[125][126] A resolution calling for a humanitarian pause passed on 15 November.[127] During a subsequent seven-day truce, 105 Israeli and foreign hostages were exchanged for 240 Palestinian prisoners.[128] Geopolitical divisions emerged by region, with much of the Western World providing "strong"[129] support to Israel militarily or diplomatically, including the United States (US),[130] United Kingdom (UK),[131] and Germany,[132][133] while the Islamic world and much of the Global South denounced its actions.[129][134] In response to U.S. backing of Israel, Iranian-backed militias attacked American bases in Iraq, Syria, and Jordan. The US, UK and other countries also engaged in conflict with the Yemeni Houthi movement, after Houthis attacked civilian commercial ships in the Red Sea they said were linked to Israel.[135][136] Houthis said they will not stop until Israel ceases its war on Gaza and allows "food, medicine and fuel to reach the besieged people."[137][138]
